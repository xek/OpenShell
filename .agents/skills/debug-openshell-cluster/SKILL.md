# Debug OpenShell Cluster

Diagnose why a openshell cluster failed to start after `openshell gateway start`.

Use **only** `openshell` CLI commands (`openshell status`, `openshell doctor logs`, `openshell doctor exec`) to inspect and fix the cluster. Do **not** use raw `docker`, `ssh`, or `kubectl` commands directly — always go through the `openshell doctor` interface. The CLI auto-resolves local vs remote gateways, so the same commands work everywhere.

## Overview

`openshell gateway start` creates a Docker container running k3s with the OpenShell server deployed via Helm. The deployment stages, in order, are:

1. **Pre-deploy check**: `openshell gateway start` in interactive mode prompts to **reuse** (keep volume, clean stale nodes) or **recreate** (destroy everything, fresh start). `mise run cluster` always recreates before deploy.
2. Ensure cluster image is available (local build or remote pull)
3. Create Docker network (`openshell-cluster`) and volume (`openshell-cluster-{name}`)
4. Create and start a privileged Docker container (`openshell-cluster-{name}`)
5. Wait for k3s to generate kubeconfig (up to 60s)
6. **Clean stale nodes**: Remove any `NotReady` k3s nodes left over from previous container instances that reused the same persistent volume
7. **Prepare local images** (if `OPENSHELL_PUSH_IMAGES` is set): In `internal` registry mode, bootstrap waits for the in-cluster registry and pushes tagged images there. In `external` mode, bootstrap uses legacy `ctr -n k8s.io images import` push-mode behavior.
8. **Reconcile TLS PKI**: Load existing TLS secrets from the cluster; if missing, incomplete, or malformed, generate fresh PKI (CA + server + client certs). Apply secrets to cluster. If rotation happened and the OpenShell workload is already running, rollout restart and wait for completion (failed rollout aborts deploy).
9. **Store CLI mTLS credentials**: Persist client cert/key/CA locally for CLI authentication.
10. Wait for cluster health checks to pass (up to 6 min):
    - k3s API server readiness (`/readyz`)
    - `openshell` statefulset ready in `openshell` namespace
    - TLS secrets `openshell-server-tls` and `openshell-client-tls` exist in `openshell` namespace
    - Sandbox supervisor binary exists at `/opt/openshell/bin/openshell-sandbox` (emits `HEALTHCHECK_MISSING_SUPERVISOR` marker if absent)

For local deploys, metadata endpoint selection now depends on Docker connectivity:

- default local Docker socket (`unix:///var/run/docker.sock`): `https://127.0.0.1:{port}` (default port 8080)
- TCP Docker daemon (`DOCKER_HOST=tcp://<host>:<port>`): `https://<host>:{port}` for non-loopback hosts

The host port is configurable via `--port` on `openshell gateway start` (default 8080) and is stored in `ClusterMetadata.gateway_port`.

The TCP host is also added as an extra gateway TLS SAN so mTLS hostname validation succeeds.

The default cluster name is `openshell`. The container is `openshell-cluster-{name}`.

## Prerequisites

- Docker must be running (locally or on the remote host)
- The `openshell` CLI must be available
- For remote clusters: SSH access to the remote host

## Tools Available

All diagnostics go through three `openshell` commands. They auto-resolve local vs remote gateways — the same commands work for both:

```bash
# Quick connectivity check
openshell status

# Fetch container logs
openshell doctor logs --lines 100
openshell doctor logs --tail          # stream live

# Run any command inside the gateway container (KUBECONFIG is pre-configured)
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl get pods -A
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell logs statefulset/openshell --tail=100
openshell doctor exec -- cat /etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml
openshell doctor exec -- df -h /
openshell doctor exec -- free -h
openshell doctor exec -- sh           # interactive shell
```

## Workflow

When the user asks to debug a cluster failure, **run diagnostics automatically** through the steps below in order. Stop and report findings as soon as a root cause is identified. Do not ask the user to choose which checks to run.

### Determine Context

Before running commands, establish:

1. **Cluster name**: Default is `openshell`, giving container name `openshell-cluster-openshell`
2. **Remote or local**: The `openshell doctor` commands auto-resolve this from gateway metadata — no special flags needed for the active gateway
3. **Config directory**: `~/.config/openshell/gateways/{name}/`

### Step 0: Quick Connectivity Check

Run `openshell status` first. This immediately reveals:
- Which gateway and endpoint the CLI is targeting
- Whether the CLI can reach the server (mTLS handshake success/failure)
- The server version if connected

Common errors at this stage:
- **`tls handshake eof`**: The server isn't running or mTLS credentials are missing/mismatched
- **`connection refused`**: The container isn't running or port mapping is broken
- **`No gateway configured`**: No gateway has been deployed yet

### Step 1: Check Container Logs

Get recent container logs to identify startup failures:

```bash
openshell doctor logs --lines 100
```

Look for:

- DNS resolution failures in the entrypoint script
- k3s startup errors (certificate issues, port binding failures)
- Manifest copy errors from `/opt/openshell/manifests/`
- `iptables` or `cgroup` errors (privilege/capability issues)

### Step 2: Check k3s Cluster Health

Verify k3s itself is functional:

```bash
# API server readiness
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl get --raw="/readyz"

# Node status
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl get nodes -o wide

# All pods
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl get pods -A -o wide
```

If `/readyz` fails, k3s is still starting or has crashed. Check container logs (Step 1).

If pods are in `CrashLoopBackOff`, `ImagePullBackOff`, or `Pending`, investigate those pods specifically.

Also check for node pressure conditions that cause the kubelet to evict pods and reject scheduling:

```bash
# Check node conditions (DiskPressure, MemoryPressure, PIDPressure)
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath="{range .items[*]}{.metadata.name}{range .status.conditions[*]} {.type}={.status}{end}{\"\n\"}{end}"

# Check disk usage inside the container
openshell doctor exec -- df -h /

# Check memory usage
openshell doctor exec -- free -h
```

If any pressure condition is `True`, pods will be evicted and new ones rejected. The bootstrap now detects `HEALTHCHECK_NODE_PRESSURE` markers from the health-check script and aborts early with a clear diagnosis. To fix: free disk/memory on the host, then recreate the gateway.

### Step 3: Check OpenShell Server StatefulSet

The OpenShell server is deployed via a HelmChart CR as a StatefulSet named `openshell` in the `openshell` namespace. Check its status:

```bash
# StatefulSet status
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell get statefulset/openshell -o wide

# OpenShell pod logs
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell logs statefulset/openshell --tail=100

# Describe statefulset for events
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell describe statefulset/openshell

# Helm install job logs (the job that installs the OpenShell chart)
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n kube-system logs -l job-name=helm-install-openshell --tail=200
```

Common issues:

- **Replicas 0/0**: The StatefulSet has been scaled to zero — no pods are running. This can happen after a failed deploy, manual scale-down, or Helm values misconfiguration. Fix: `openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell scale statefulset openshell --replicas=1`
- **ImagePullBackOff**: The component image failed to pull. In `internal` mode, verify internal registry readiness and pushed image tags (Step 5). In `external` mode, check `/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml` credentials/endpoints and DNS (Step 8). Default external registry is `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/` (public, no auth required). If using a private registry, ensure `--registry-username` and `--registry-token` (or `OPENSHELL_REGISTRY_USERNAME`/`OPENSHELL_REGISTRY_TOKEN`) were provided during deploy.
- **CrashLoopBackOff**: The server is crashing. Check pod logs for the actual error.
- **Pending**: Insufficient resources or scheduling constraints.

### Step 4: Check Networking

The OpenShell server is exposed via a NodePort service on port `30051`:

```bash
# Service status
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell get service/openshell
```

Expected port: `30051/tcp` (mapped to configurable host port, default 8080; set via `--port` on deploy).

### Step 5: Check Image Availability

Component images (server, sandbox) can reach kubelet via two paths:

**Local/external pull mode** (default local via `mise run cluster`): Local images are tagged to the configured local registry base (default `127.0.0.1:5000/openshell/*`), pushed to that registry, and pulled by k3s via `registries.yaml` mirror endpoint (typically `host.docker.internal:5000`). The `cluster` task pushes prebuilt local tags (`openshell/*:dev`, falling back to `localhost:5000/openshell/*:dev` or `127.0.0.1:5000/openshell/*:dev`).

```bash
# Verify image refs currently used by openshell deployment
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell get statefulset openshell -o jsonpath="{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].image}"

# Verify registry mirror/auth endpoint configuration
openshell doctor exec -- cat /etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml
```

**Legacy push mode**: Images are imported into the k3s containerd `k8s.io` namespace.

```bash
# Check if images were imported into containerd (k3s default namespace is k8s.io)
openshell doctor exec -- ctr -a /run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock images ls | grep openshell
```

**External pull mode** (remote deploy, or local with `OPENSHELL_REGISTRY_HOST`/`IMAGE_REPO_BASE` pointing at a non-local registry): Images are pulled from an external registry at runtime. The entrypoint generates `/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml`.

```bash
# Verify registries.yaml exists and has credentials
openshell doctor exec -- cat /etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml

# Test pulling an image manually from inside the cluster
openshell doctor exec -- crictl pull ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell/gateway:latest
```

If `registries.yaml` is missing or has wrong values, verify env wiring (`OPENSHELL_REGISTRY_HOST`, `OPENSHELL_REGISTRY_INSECURE`, username/password for authenticated registries).

### Step 6: Check mTLS / PKI

TLS certificates are generated by the `openshell-bootstrap` crate (using `rcgen`) and stored as K8s secrets before the Helm release installs. There is no PKI job or cert-manager — certificates are applied directly via `kubectl apply`.

```bash
# Check if the three TLS secrets exist
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell get secret openshell-server-tls openshell-server-client-ca openshell-client-tls

# Inspect server cert expiry (if openssl is available in the container)
openshell doctor exec -- sh -c 'kubectl -n openshell get secret openshell-server-tls -o jsonpath="{.data.tls\.crt}" | base64 -d | openssl x509 -noout -dates 2>/dev/null || echo "openssl not available"'

# Check if CLI-side mTLS files exist locally
ls -la ~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/mtls/
```

On redeploy, bootstrap reuses existing secrets if they are valid PEM. If secrets are missing or malformed, fresh PKI is generated and the OpenShell workload is automatically restarted. If the rollout restart fails after rotation, the deploy aborts and CLI-side certs are not updated. Certificates use rcgen defaults (effectively never expire).

If the local mTLS files are missing but the secrets exist in the cluster, you can extract them manually:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/mtls
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell get secret openshell-client-tls -o jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 -d > ~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/mtls/ca.crt
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell get secret openshell-client-tls -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d > ~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/mtls/tls.crt
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell get secret openshell-client-tls -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.key}' | base64 -d > ~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/mtls/tls.key
```

Common mTLS issues:
- **Secrets missing**: The `openshell` namespace may not have been created yet (Helm controller race). Bootstrap waits up to 2 minutes for the namespace.
- **mTLS mismatch after manual secret deletion**: Delete all three secrets and redeploy — bootstrap will regenerate and restart the workload.
- **CLI can't connect after redeploy**: Check that `~/.config/openshell/gateways/<name>/mtls/` contains `ca.crt`, `tls.crt`, `tls.key` and that they were updated at deploy time.
- **Local mTLS files missing**: The gateway was deployed but CLI credentials weren't persisted (e.g., interrupted deploy). Extract from the cluster secret as shown above.

### Step 7: Check Kubernetes Events

Events catch scheduling failures, image pull errors, and resource issues:

```bash
openshell doctor exec -- kubectl get events -A --sort-by=.lastTimestamp | tail -n 50
```

Look for:

- `FailedScheduling` — resource constraints
- `ImagePullBackOff` / `ErrImagePull` — registry auth failure or DNS issue (check `/etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml`)
- `CrashLoopBackOff` — application crashes
- `OOMKilled` — memory limits too low
- `FailedMount` — volume issues

### Step 8: Check DNS Resolution

DNS misconfiguration is a common root cause, especially on remote/Linux hosts:

```bash
# Check the resolv.conf k3s is using
openshell doctor exec -- cat /etc/rancher/k3s/resolv.conf

# Test DNS resolution from inside the container
openshell doctor exec -- sh -c 'nslookup google.com || wget -q -O /dev/null http://google.com && echo "network ok" || echo "network unreachable"'
```

Check the entrypoint's DNS decision in the container logs:

```bash
openshell doctor logs --lines 20
```

The entrypoint script selects DNS resolvers in this priority:

1. Viable nameservers from `/etc/resolv.conf` (not loopback/link-local)
2. Docker `ExtServers` from `/etc/resolv.conf` comments
3. Host gateway IP (Docker Desktop only, `192.168.*`)
4. Fallback to `8.8.8.8` / `8.8.4.4`

If DNS is broken, all image pulls from the distribution registry will fail, as will pods that need external network access.

## Common Failure Patterns

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `tls handshake eof` from `openshell status` | Server not running or mTLS credentials missing/mismatched | Check StatefulSet replicas (Step 3) and mTLS files (Step 6) |
| StatefulSet `0/0` replicas | StatefulSet scaled to zero (failed deploy, manual scale-down, or Helm misconfiguration) | `openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell scale statefulset openshell --replicas=1` |
| Local mTLS files missing | Deploy was interrupted before credentials were persisted | Extract from cluster secret `openshell-client-tls` (Step 6) |
| Container not found | Image not built | `mise run docker:build:cluster` (local) or re-deploy (remote) |
| Container exited, OOMKilled | Insufficient memory | Increase host memory or reduce workload |
| Container exited, non-zero exit | k3s crash, port conflict, privilege issue | Check `openshell doctor logs` for details |
| `/readyz` fails | k3s still starting or crashed | Wait longer or check container logs for k3s errors |
| OpenShell pods `Pending` | Insufficient CPU/memory for scheduling, or PVC not bound | `openshell doctor exec -- kubectl describe pod -n openshell` and `openshell doctor exec -- kubectl get pvc -n openshell` |
| OpenShell pods `CrashLoopBackOff` | Server application error | `openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n openshell logs statefulset/openshell` |
| OpenShell pods `ImagePullBackOff` (push mode) | Images not imported or wrong containerd namespace | Check `openshell doctor exec -- ctr -a /run/k3s/containerd/containerd.sock -n k8s.io images ls` (Step 5) |
| OpenShell pods `ImagePullBackOff` (pull mode) | Registry auth or DNS issue | Check `openshell doctor exec -- cat /etc/rancher/k3s/registries.yaml` and DNS (Step 8) |
| Image import fails | Corrupt tar stream or containerd not ready | Retry after k3s is fully started; check container logs |
| Push mode images not found by kubelet | Imported into wrong containerd namespace | Must use `k3s ctr -n k8s.io images import`, not `k3s ctr images import` |
| mTLS secrets missing | Bootstrap couldn't apply secrets (namespace not ready) | Check deploy logs and verify `openshell` namespace exists (Step 6) |
| mTLS mismatch after redeploy | PKI rotated but workload not restarted, or rollout failed | Check that all three TLS secrets exist and that the openshell pod restarted after cert rotation (Step 6) |
| Helm install job failed | Chart values error or dependency issue | `openshell doctor exec -- kubectl -n kube-system logs -l job-name=helm-install-openshell` |
| Architecture mismatch (remote) | Built on arm64, deploying to amd64 | Cross-build the image for the target architecture |
| Port conflict | Another service on the configured gateway host port (default 8080) | Stop conflicting service or use `--port` on `openshell gateway start` to pick a different host port |
| gRPC connect refused to `127.0.0.1:443` in CI | Docker daemon is remote (`DOCKER_HOST=tcp://...`) but metadata still points to loopback | Verify metadata endpoint host matches `DOCKER_HOST` and includes non-loopback host |
| DNS failures inside container | Entrypoint DNS detection failed | `openshell doctor exec -- cat /etc/rancher/k3s/resolv.conf` and `openshell doctor logs --lines 20` |
| Node DiskPressure / MemoryPressure / PIDPressure | Insufficient disk, memory, or PIDs on host | Free disk (`docker system prune -a --volumes`), increase memory, or expand host resources. Bootstrap auto-detects via `HEALTHCHECK_NODE_PRESSURE` marker |
| Pods evicted with "The node had condition: [DiskPressure]" | Host disk full, kubelet evicting pods | Free disk space on host, then `openshell gateway destroy <name> && openshell gateway start` |
| `metrics-server` errors in logs | Normal k3s noise, not the root cause | These errors are benign — look for the actual failing health check component |
| Stale NotReady nodes from previous deploys | Volume reused across container recreations | The deploy flow now auto-cleans stale nodes; if it still fails, manually delete NotReady nodes (see Step 2) or choose "Recreate" when prompted |
| gRPC `UNIMPLEMENTED` for newer RPCs in push mode | Helm values still point at older pulled images instead of the pushed refs | Verify rendered `openshell-helmchart.yaml` uses the expected push refs (`server`, `sandbox`, `pki-job`) and not `:latest` |
| Sandbox pods crash with `/opt/openshell/bin/openshell-sandbox: no such file or directory` | Supervisor binary missing from cluster image | The cluster image was built/published without the `supervisor-builder` target in `deploy/docker/Dockerfile.images`. Rebuild with `mise run docker:build:cluster` and recreate gateway. Bootstrap auto-detects via `HEALTHCHECK_MISSING_SUPERVISOR` marker |
| `HEALTHCHECK_MISSING_SUPERVISOR` in health check logs | `/opt/openshell/bin/openshell-sandbox` not found in gateway container | Rebuild cluster image: `mise run docker:build:cluster`, then `openshell gateway destroy <name> && openshell gateway start` |

## Rootless Podman Support

OpenShell includes partial rootless Podman support. The cluster itself (k3s + gateway) works with rootless Podman, but sandbox pods cannot yet create network namespaces.

### What works

- k3s kubelet starts correctly (`KubeletInUserNamespace=true` + delegated user cgroup subtree in `cluster-entrypoint.sh`)
- Gateway deploys and is healthy
- Provider management, inference configuration, and credential refresh all work
- Image building works with `--format docker` flag (see below)

### System prerequisites (one-time setup)

Enable cgroup delegation for cpuset and hugetlb — required for k3s kubelet cgroup validation:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "+cpuset +hugetlb" >> /sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.subtree_control'
sudo sh -c 'echo "+cpuset +hugetlb" >> /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/cgroup.subtree_control'
sudo sh -c 'echo "+cpuset +hugetlb" >> /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-$(id -u).slice/cgroup.subtree_control'
```

These writes don't survive reboots. For persistence, add a systemd drop-in:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/delegate.conf
[Service]
Delegate=cpu cpuset io memory pids hugetlb
```

### Podman socket

Start the podman user socket before deploying:

```bash
systemctl --user start podman.socket
```

### Image build format

Podman builds images in OCI format by default, which drops the HEALTHCHECK instruction (required by the bootstrap). Build with `--format docker`:

```bash
DOCKER_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 mise run cluster
```

Or use a docker shim that adds `--format docker` automatically.

### Sandbox pods (remaining gap)

Sandbox pods crash with `EPERM` when the supervisor tries to create network namespaces and veth pairs. The root cause: in rootless k3s, pod capabilities (`SYS_ADMIN`, `NET_ADMIN`) are user-namespace-scoped and cannot create veth pairs bridging to the host network namespace.

**What was tried:** `hostUsers: false` on sandbox pods would give the supervisor its own user namespace with virtual root, allowing veth creation. This was confirmed to work: `unshare --user --map-root-user --net; ip link add veth0 type veth peer veth1` succeeds inside the cluster container.

**Current blocker:** containerd's noop process (used to pin the pod sandbox user+net namespace) hardcodes `/proc/self/exe` as the namespace holder binary and does not establish UID mapping before execing. The exec fails with `EPERM` in rootless environments. This is a containerd limitation — the noop binary path is not configurable.

**Symptoms:**
```
Failed to create pod sandbox: failed to create network namespace for sandbox:
  failed to start noop process for unshare: fork/exec /proc/self/exe: operation not permitted
```

**Next steps:** Either contribute a fix to containerd to support configurable noop binary or use UID mapping correctly before exec, or implement slirp4netns-based networking in the sandbox supervisor as an alternative to veth pairs.
